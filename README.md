# In-vitro Project


Quantified plant leaf protein using the Lowry method, an in vitro colorimetric assay known for its accuracy in protein estimation.
This method involves the reaction of peptide bonds with copper ions under alkaline conditions, followed by the reduction of the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent, resulting in a color change proportional to protein concentration.
The assay provided precise and reliable protein quantification, facilitating detailed and accurate analysis for subsequent biological research and experiments. 
The outcome included high-quality data on protein levels, essential for understanding various biological processes and advancing research initiatives.
